Learning Locker Language Files
==============================

To create a new language pack you can clone this repo and add new files into the lang/ folder. Create a sub folder within lang/ for the specific language using the region code e.g. en / fr and so on. If you prefer, we also use Transifex to help aid translation - see below.

To use with your install of Learning Locker, grab and move to the app/lang folder.

Translation tool
================

Here is the [Learning Locker project on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/organization/learning-locker/dashboard) - it provides a handy interface to help track how many strings are needing translated for any language being worked on.
