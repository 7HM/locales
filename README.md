Learning Locker Language Files
==============================

To create a new language pack you can clone this repo and add new files into the lang/ folder. Create a sub folder within lang/ for the specific language using the region code e.g. en / fr and so on. If you prefer, we also use Transifex to help aid translation - see below.

To use with your install of Learning Locker, grab and move to the app/lang folder.

Translation tool
================

Here is the [Learning Locker project on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/organization/learning-locker/dashboard) - it provides a handy interface to help track how many strings are needing translated for any language being worked on.

The files on Transifex are automatically updated when we make changes to the core english files in Learning Locker. As they are translated, we merge
them here.
